A bit of a backstory for this one. NameNotFound contacted me and asked if I wanted to collab with him. I said yes and we began to work on a client called Eclipse Client, a mod of Eaglercraft Beta 1.3. That was a while ago, and we just eventually stopped working on it. But recently I wanted to continue making this client, so here we are!

## Lore

Lore?? In Eaglercraft? Amazing!

"Ever since the moon broke apart and the sun turned into a red dwarf, many things on the planet Luxu became hostile and bound to destruction. Humans caught in the cross fire of the falling moon shards became 'Flesh Seekers', eating the their victims until they are just bones. Seekers rely on their hearing because they rip their eyes out the second they became infected. Even the dead aren't save, their skeletons rise up from the ground, carrying bows enchanted with rapid fire, able to wipe out anything they deem a threat in a matter of seconds. Spiders began to grow in size, and a new creature born from the changed flora dubbed 'The Bombers', silently approach people to then explode, killing both in the process.

Not all humans, including you, were wiped into Seekers or Skeletons. Many hid in the caves, evolving to have bigger eyes. They are called the 'Homo-Ojo', meaning 'Eyed One'. Others stayed on the surface, staying mostly the same except for some different features in face and body. Either way, you should be lucky to not suffer a fate worse than death.

The Flora of the world were not safe aswell, most trees turned from a beautiful green to a hidious purple. Some trees began to shine a nice light, others pusling a red fluid. Grass stayed the same, but the cacti began to flower a purple rose on top of them.

Either way, finding humans in this day and age are few and far between, many die after their first night alone, so be careful, or otherwise a fate that no-one, not even the wicked would wish on you, will happen."
