A bit of a backstory for this one. NameNotFound contacted me and asked if I wanted to collab with him. I said yes and we began to work on a client called Eclipse Client, a mod of Eaglercraft Beta 1.3. That was a while ago, and we just eventually stopped working on it. But recently I wanted to continue making this client, so here we are!
